# <Random Password Generator>

## For the MSU Bootcamp Homework 3, we are tasked with creating a random password generator for guests that visit my website.
    - This is my first project incorporating Javascript. 

## Acceptance Criteria
    Created by the MSU Coding Bootcamp
    
GIVEN I need a new, secure password
WHEN I click the button to generate a password
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
WHEN asked for character types to include in the password
THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page

# First Submission Notes
Hello Cameron,

I could see that you did not deploy your application to GitHub Pages so I was able to clone it down locally and still provide a grade. When I ran the application it provided a password upon click of Generate Password that was all of the characters you input into the array in your JavaScript. 

After examining your JavaScript I could see that your file contains very little JavaScript and has no functionality resembling the mock up password generator. Many students have difficulty with this first assignment as they believe all that is required is a generated password when in actuality 

the password needs to be randomized 
and the application needs to intake user input. 
The application also centers around handling user input error via conditionals and I can see you have started with the pseudo code to satisfy these items, but the actual code is not present. 

Please reach out to your instructional staff, AskBCS and your tutor as they are the resources you have at your disposal to assist with completing these Challenges on time.

I wish you best of luck moving forward in the BootCamp!
